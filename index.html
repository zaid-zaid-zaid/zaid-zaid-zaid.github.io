            <!-- First paragraph -->
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                I am a first-year PhD student at Columbia. Previously, I was an
                undergraduate at Berkeley, and a graduate student at Oxford supported by
                a <a href="https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/study-here/graduate-studies/admissions/finance/peter-thomason-studentship/" class="links" target="_blank">Peter Thomason Scholarship</a>. My research interests are in probability, statistics,
                and algorithms, broadly defined.
            </p>

            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                I also like markets. A few years ago, I interned at Google, developing and scaling recommendation systems for the Shopping team. More recently, I've spent time working on macro L/S at Caxton Associates,  
                systematic equities at BlackRock, and high-yield fixed income research at Citadel. 
            </p>

            <!-- Second paragraph -->
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">
                I had the pleasure of growing up first in San Francisco and then in London, Bangalore, and Seattle. I also love surfing, marathon running,
                and reading. In a former life, I captained the surf team at Berkeley and played soccer for the San Jose Earthquakes and Seattle
                Sounders Development Academies.

            <p style="font-size: 16px;"><strong>A note on my name:</strong> People often struggle with my name. It's pronounced "Zed," like "Ted," with a "Z."</p>
